# This script determines the 50 best matching control samples. Selection of these 
# samples is based on the lowest sum of squares.
# this is calculated by subtracting chromosome fraction of controls by cromosomal fraction of sample.
# The result is squared and summed. The 50 control samples with the lowest result are selected as best control
